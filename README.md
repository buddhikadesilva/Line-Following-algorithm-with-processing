- what is line following?
- Line Following is one of the most important aspects of robotics. A Line Following Robot is an autonomous robot which is able to follow either a black or white line that is drawn on the surface consisting of a contrasting color.
- Some techniques which are used in digital image processing include:
Anisotropic diffusion.
Hidden Markov models.
Image editing.
Image restoration.
Independent component analysis.
Linear filtering.
Neural networks.
Partial differential equations.
