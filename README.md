# Line-Following-algorithm-with-processing
Line Following algorithm with processing using a webcam.

Dependencies :
- openCV for processing.
- video library.

Just install it from library tab in processing software menu. Also install the video library.
now you are ready to use this code.
Happy Coding !

- what is line following?
- Line Following is one of the most important aspects of robotics. A Line Following Robot is an autonomous robot which is able to follow either a black or white line that is drawn on the surface consisting of a contrasting color.
- Some techniques which are used in digital image processing include:
Anisotropic diffusion.
Hidden Markov models.
Image editing.
Image restoration.
Independent component analysis.
Linear filtering.
Neural networks.
Partial differential equations.
- Robotic engineers are designing the next generation of robots to look, feel and act more human, to make it easier for us to warm up to a cold machine. Rescue Robots. Robotic Competitions. Robotic Prosthetics. Walking Robots. Robot Caregivers.
-What is the future for robots?
Future of Robotics & Artificial Intelligence. According to a Forrester report, robots will eliminate 6 percent of all jobs in the U.S. by 2021. McKinsey's assessment is even more expansive â€” they believe that by 2030 one-third of American jobs could become automated.
